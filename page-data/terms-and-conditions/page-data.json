IF IN DOUBT, PLEASE CONSULT AND SEEK PROFESSIONAL ADVICE FROM YOUR ADVISORS BEFORE PROCEEDING TO REGISTER OR APPLY FOR OR USE ANY PART OF THE TENX SERVICES.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>THESE TERMS GOVERN YOUR APPLICATION FOR, HOLDING OF OR USE OF A TENX WALLET ACCOUNT THROUGH THE TENX WALLET APP AND YOUR APPLICATION FOR, POSSESSION OF OR USE OF THE CARD.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BY YOUR REGISTRATION FOR A TENX WALLET ACCOUNT, CONTINUED HOLDING OR USE OF A TENX WALLET ACCOUNT THROUGH THE TENX WALLET APP, APPLICATION FOR A CARD AND/OR YOUR CONTINUED POSSESSION OR USE OF THE CARD, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE FULLY UNDERSTOOD THESE TERMS IN THEIR ENTIRETY, AND YOU AGREE WITH AND ACCEPT THESE TERMS IN THEIR ENTIRETY AS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND TENX (AS DEFINED BELOW).

You are solely responsible for understanding and complying with any and all applicable laws, rules and regulations in connection with your acceptance of these Terms and your use of any part of the TenX Services, including but not limited to those related to taxes or foreign currency transactions as well as reporting and disclosure obligations. To the best of the knowledge and belief of TenX, all risk factors which are material to you in making an informed judgement as to whether to accept these Terms and use any part of the TenX Services have been set out below. However, the list of risk factors set out below is only a non-exhaustive list for your consideration, and other risks, arising either now or in the future, could additionally be relevant and applicable to you in making an informed judgement as to whether to accept, or continue to accept, these Terms and/or use, or continue to use, the TenX Services. </p>\n<p><strong>Risk of Funds Not Being Immediately Available</strong></p>\n<p>TenX may close, suspend, or limit your access to any part of the TenX Services (as defined below), and/or restrict your access to the Available Balance (as defined below) of your TenX Wallet Account (as defined below) for so long as reasonably required to protect against the risk of liability if you violate, breach or fail to comply with any part of these Terms and the Policies (as defined below). For the avoidance of doubt, TenX may also permanently close, suspend, or limit your access to the TenX Services if you violate, breach or fail to comply with any part of these Terms and the Policies.</p>\n<p>Please note that your TenX Wallet Account has two (2) separate and distinct functionalities, which are the payment functionality and the reserve functionality. Your ability to access the Available Balance for purposes of making a Card Transaction or TenX Wallet Transaction (each as defined below) using the Available Balance of your TenX Wallet Account will depend upon whether the Available Balance (which is the subject of such transaction) is associated with the payment functionality or the reserve functionality. </p>\n<p>For the purposes of these Terms: </p>\n<p>(a)\tThe element of your TenX Wallet Account which constitutes the payment functionality is known as the <strong>\"payment account\"</strong>. Such payment account is the operational part of your TenX Wallet Account through which you have access to your Available Balance and which can be used for the execution of Card Transactions or TenX Wallet Transactions. </p>\n<p>(b)\tThe element of your TenX Wallet Account which constitutes the reserve functionality is known as the <strong>\"reserve\"</strong>. Your access to the reserve is restricted and you have no ability to use the Available Balance held in the reserve or to execute TenX Wallet Transactions or Card Transactions using the Available Balance held in the reserve. Any Available Balance held in the reserve may be marked or categorised, for example, as \"pending\", \"under review\", \"risk reserve\" or other similar indications or categorisations. The temporary holding of Available Balance in such reserve by TenX is related to TenX’s assessment and determination, at its sole and absolute discretion, of certain AML, CFT, fraud, financial and other regulatory risks.</p>\n<p><strong>Payment Execution Risks</strong></p>\n<p>Please note that following TenX’s receipt of your payment order or instructions to proceed with a transaction in connection with the Accepted Assets (as defined below), TenX will process or execute such transaction (and where applicable, also credit the relevant payment service provider) as quickly as the relevant payment schemes and financial networks allow (and such transaction may be completed by the next business day following the date of TenX’s receipt of your payment order or instructions). </p>\n<p><strong>Price Change Risk Associated with Using Virtual Currencies</strong></p>\n<p>Prices of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets fluctuate day by day or even hour by hour. The value of your Available Balance could surge or drop suddenly. Please note that there is a possibility that the price of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets could drop to zero. Prices of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets are prone to significant fluctuations, for example, due to announced proposed legislative acts, governmental restrictions, news related to cyber-crimes or other factors causing potentially excessive market enthusiasm or disproportionate loss in confidence. Prices of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets can also be manipulated.</p>\n<p><strong>Liquidity Risk and the Nature of Virtual Currencies</strong></p>\n<p>Your TenX Wallet Account and the Available Balance of your TenX Wallet Account are not protected by the relevant deposit guarantee or investment indemnity schemes in the jurisdiction(s) of TenX or the Card Issuer.</p>\n<p>Virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as those which are the Accepted Assets are not legal tender and are not backed by any government. Unlike fiat currencies, which are regulated and backed by local governments and central banks, virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as those which are the Accepted Assets may be based only on technology and user consensus. In cases of massive manipulations or market panic, central governments will not take any corrective actions or measures to achieve stability, maintain liquidity or protect the value of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as those which are the Accepted Assets. </p>\n<p>There is a possibility that executed orders with respect to certain trades of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as those which are the Accepted Assets cannot be settled or may be difficult to settle, or can be completed only at significantly adverse prices depending on the market situation and/or market volume for certain virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as those which are the Accepted Assets. </p>\n<p>There is also no assurance that TenX will continue to accept the Accepted Assets for purposes of use of the Available Balance to carry out TenX Wallet Transactions or Card Transactions, or that the Card Issuer, Visa or Merchants will continue to permit Card Transactions, in the future. </p>\n<p><strong>Blockchain Network Risk</strong></p>\n<p>Completion of certain transactions in connection with virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as those which are the Accepted Assets on blockchains can be deferred for a certain period of time until an adequate number of confirmations has been received. A TenX Wallet Transaction or a Card Transaction (to the extent that it is blockchain-based) will not be reflected in your TenX Wallet Account until such adequate number of confirmations has been received and confirmed by TenX. There is a possibility that your TenX Wallet Transactions and Card Transactions (to the extent that they are blockchain-based) may be cancelled or remain unconfirmed on blockchains. Transactions in connection with virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as those which are the Accepted Assets may be irreversible, and, accordingly, Losses (as defined below) due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some transactions in connection with virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as those which are the Accepted Assets shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time when you or another party initiated the transaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk of Using External Wallet Services and Exchange Services</strong></p>\n<p>In the case where you use an external cryptocurrency wallet or a cryptocurrency wallet which is established or maintained with an Exchange (as defined below) and you do not have secure possession of your private key or credentials to access such cryptocurrency wallet, you may not be able to access your virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets including those which are Accepted Assets. TenX is also under no obligation, and may not be able, to assist you in such case.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk of Using TenX Wallet Account and TenX Wallet App</strong></p>\n<p>While TenX is committed to high standards for maintaining the security of all private keys to the cryptocurrency wallets associated with TenX Wallet Accounts, TenX is not responsible and is not liable for any Loss resulting from any loss, theft, or inappropriate or unauthorised disclosure of and/or use of the private keys to the cryptocurrency wallet associated with your TenX Wallet Account where such loss, theft, or inappropriate or unauthorised disclosure of and/or use is not within the control of TenX. TenX is also under no obligation to take any corrective action or measure in the event of any such loss, theft, or inappropriate or unauthorised disclosure of and/or use.</p>\n<p><strong>Force Majeure</strong></p>\n<p>There is a risk that your Card Transactions or TenX Wallet Transactions may be affected by system failures resulting from adverse events, natural disasters and other emergencies and unforeseen significant changes in the external environment. With regard to any Loss due to occurrences such as emergency situations and Force Majeure events, TenX is under no obligation to take any corrective action or measure.  </p>\n<p><strong>Regulatory Uncertainty</strong></p>\n<p>The regulatory frameworks applicable to payment services providers and transactions in connection with virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as those which are the Accepted Assets are still developing and in a state of flux. It is possible that your Card Transactions or TenX Wallet Transactions are, or may be in the future, subject to various reporting, tax or other liabilities and obligations. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the country, regional (for example, in the EU or an EEA) or international level may materially and adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as those which are the Accepted Assets.</p>\n<h3>YOU AND TENX HEREBY AGREE AS FOLLOWS:</h3>\n<p><strong>1.\tDEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION</strong></p>\n<p>In these Terms, the following words and expressions shall have the following meanings: </p>\n<p>1.1\t<strong>“AML”</strong> means anti-money laundering. </p>\n<p>1.2\t“Accepted Assets” means such virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens, other digital assets and/or fiat currencies as may be compatible with and supported by the TenX Wallet App and the TenX Wallet Account, with the list of such virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens, other digital assets and/or fiat currencies being as set out in Annex 1 hereto and subject to change from time to time by TenX at its sole and absolute discretion.</p>\n<p>1.3\t<strong>“Applicable Exchange Rate”</strong>, in relation to a particular time, means such exchange rate representing the value (in the relevant fiat currency) of each unit of an Accepted Asset as may be determined by TenX in its sole and absolute discretion to be applicable for purposes of calculating the value (in the relevant fiat currency) of the Available Balance of a TenX Wallet Account, the value of a Card Transaction (in terms of such Accepted Asset) or the payable fees as referred to in Paragraph 17 below (in terms of such Accepted Asset) at such time.</p>\n<p>1.4\t<strong>“Applicable Laws”</strong>, means applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements of any government or authority in any jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>1.5\t<strong>“Arbitration Rules and Regulations”</strong> has the meaning ascribed thereto in Paragraph 32.5 below.</p>\n<p>1.6\t“Available Balance” means, in relation to a particular time:</p>\n<p>(a)\tthe value (in the relevant fiat currency) of the Accepted Assets held by you through your TenX Wallet Account based on the Applicable Exchange Rate at such time; or</p>\n<p>(b)\tthe respective amounts of Accepted Assets held by you through your TenX Wallet Account as at the time of such TenX Wallet Transaction at such time.</p>\n<p>1.7\t<strong>“Business Account”</strong> has the meaning ascribed thereto in Paragraph 3.2A below.</p>\n<p>1.8\t<strong>“Business Customer”</strong> has the meaning ascribed thereto in Paragraph 3.2A below.</p>\n<p>1.9\t<strong>“Card”</strong> means a prepaid Visa® travel card issued by the Card Issuer to you for the purposes of a Card Programme. </p>\n<p>1.10\t<strong>“Card Issuer”</strong> means Wirecard Singapore Pte.

TenX does not bear any liability in the event that you or a third party incurs any Losses as a result of any airdrop, fork, hack, mining attack (including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), cyber-attack, distributed denials of service, technical and/or system failure and/or error, vulnerability, defect, flaw in programming or source code or any other occurrence resulting in a change in the structure or source code of any blockchain, or lack of corrective actions or measures taken by TenX or if TenX decides to cease its support of Accepted Assets with the TenX Wallet App.</p>\n<p>10.11\tTo the maximum extent permitted by the Applicable Laws, TenX shall be entitled, at any time in its sole and absolute discretion, to determine and vary the types of TenX Wallet Transactions and Card Transactions that may be carried out with your TenX Wallet Account through the TenX Wallet App and the Card and the list of Merchants which are participating in the relevant Card Programme. </p>\n<p>10.12\tWithout prejudice to any other provision of these Terms and to the maximum extent permitted by the Applicable Laws, TenX will treat any grant by you to another person of access to your Credentials as your authorisation of use of your Card and you will be liable for all TenX Wallet Transactions and Card Transactions and fees incurred by such person, and you shall be wholly responsible for all such TenX Wallet Transactions and Card Transactions.  </p>\n<h4>11.\tPROLONGED INACTIVITY</h4>\n<p>In the event of very prolonged period inactivity in respect of your TenX Wallet Account and the Available Balance of your TenX Wallet Account is positive, TenX shall attempt to contact you with such contact details based on the Customer Information provided by you to TenX. However, if TenX is unable to contact you, and if the Applicable Laws require TenX to report such Available Balance as unclaimed property to the applicable regulatory authority or law enforcement body and deliver the Accepted Assets comprising such Available Balance to the applicable jurisdiction as unclaimed property. To the maximum extent permitted by the Applicable Laws, TenX reserves the right to deduct such amounts of the Available Balance of your TenX Wallet Account for administrative fees in connection with such prolonged period of inactivity, such attempt to contact you and/or such report.</p>\n<h4>12.\tRESPONSIBILITY FOR USE OF EXTERNAL WALLETS</h4>\n<p>12.1\tYou shall be solely responsible for your use of any External Wallet and your compliance with any and all applicable terms and conditions which are prescribed by the provider of the services of such External Wallet.
