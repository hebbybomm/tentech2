To the extent that Payments Services Directive (EU) 2015/2366 and the EU E-Money Directive 2009/110/EC and their equivalents in any implementations in member states of the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA) are applicable to these Terms and specific services offered to you, these Terms constitute a “<strong>framework contract</strong>” as defined in Article 4 of the Directive between you and TenX Payments Europe AG, an electronic money institution established in the Principality of Liechtenstein and  registered with the number FL-0002.592.666-6. Your funds stored with TenX are not protected by deposit protection scheme, however, they will always be placed on dedicated segregation account, as required by law, and would not be impacted in case of TenX insolvency.\nThese Terms incorporate, and you hereby accept and agree with, the Privacy Policy, Important Information on Key Risks, Fees Schedules, other applicable policies, other terms and conditions as may be prescribed by TenX, notices, procedures, specifications, FAQs, guides and guidelines that are provided or made available to you, appear on the TenX Website or are referred to in these Terms and which TenX may modify from time to time (collectively, the “<strong>Policies</strong>”). </p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON KEY RISKS</strong></p>\n<p><em>This section of these Terms highlights some of the risks associated with transactions in connection with virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets, payments services and other risks which TenX would like you to consider before accepting these Terms and using any part of the TenX Services. You are solely responsible for understanding and complying with any and all applicable laws, rules and regulations in connection with your acceptance of these Terms and your use of any part of the TenX Services, including but not limited to those related to taxes or foreign currency transactions as well as reporting and disclosure obligations. To the best of the knowledge and belief of TenX, all risk factors which are material to you in making an informed judgement to accept these Terms and use any part of the TenX Services have been set out below. However, the list of risk factors set out below is only a non-exhaustive list for your consideration, and other risks, arising either now or in the future, could additionally be relevant and applicable to you in making an informed judgement to accept, or continue to accept, these Terms and/or use, or continue to use, the TenX Services.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Risk of Funds Not Being Immediately Available</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>TenX may close, suspend, or limit your access to any part of the TenX Services (as defined below), and/or restrict your access to the Available Balance (as defined below) of your TenX Account (as defined below) for so long as reasonably required to protect against the risk of liability if you violate, breach or fail to comply with any part of these Terms, the Card Issuer Terms and the Policies (as defined below). For the avoidance of doubt, TenX may also permanently close, suspend, or limit your access to the TenX Services if you violate, breach or fail to comply with any part of these Terms, the Card Issuer Terms and the Policies.</em></p>\n<p><em>Please note that your TenX Account has two (2) separate and distinct functionalities, which are the payments functionality and the reserve functionality. Your ability to access the Available Balance for purposes of making a Card Transaction or TenX Transaction (each as defined below) using the Available Balance of your TenX Account will depend upon whether the Available Balance (which is the subject of such transaction) is associated with the payments functionality or the reserve functionality. The crypto custody services associated with the TenX Account are not provided by TenX Payments Europe AG, but only by TenX PTE Ltd., Singapore.</em></p>\n<p><em>For the purposes of these Terms:</em></p>\n<p>*a) The element of your TenX Account which constitutes the payments functionality is known as the <strong>e-money and/or payment account (“payment account”)</strong>. Such payment account is the operational part of your TenX Account through which you have access to your Available Balance and which can be used for the execution of Card Transactions or TenX Wallet Transactions, for example, for the purpose of buying and selling goods and services or making person-to-person payments.*</p>\n<p><em>b) The element of your TenX Account which constitutes the reserve functionality is known as the \"<strong>reserve</strong>\". Your access to the reserve is restricted and you have no ability to use the Available Balance held in the reserve or to execute TenX Wallet Transactions or Card Transactions using the Available Balance held in the reserve. Any Available Balance held in the reserve may be marked or categorised, for example, as \"pending\", \"under review\", \"risk reserve\" or other similar indications or categorisations. The temporary holding of Available Balance in such reserve by TenX is related to TenX’s and/or the Card Issuer’s assessment and determination, at its sole and absolute discretion, of certain AML, CFT, fraud, financial and other regulatory risks.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Payment Execution Risks</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Please note that following TenX’s receipt of your payment instruction or instruction to proceed with a transaction in connection with the Accepted Assets, TenX will process or execute such transaction (and where applicable, also credit the relevant payment service provider or partner) as quickly as the relevant payment schemes and financial networks allow (and such transaction may be completed by the next business day following the date of TenX’s receipt of your payment instruction or instructions, if the transaction is made in EUROs; however, transactions in other currencies or assets may take longer time, depending on the cut-off limitations and execution times of the payments and processing partners involved).</em> </p>\n<p><strong><em>Price Change Risk Associated with Using Virtual Currencies</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Prices of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets (as defined below) fluctuate day by day or even hour by hour. The value of your Available Balance could surge or drop suddenly. Please note that there is a possibility that the price of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets could drop to zero. Prices of virtual currencies are prone to significant fluctuations, for example, due to announced proposed legislative acts, governmental restrictions, news related to cyber-crimes or other factors causing potentially excessive market enthusiasm or disproportionate loss in confidence. Prices of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets can also be manipulated.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Liquidity Risk and the Nature of Virtual Currencies</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Your TenX Account and the Available Balance of your TenX Account are not protected by the relevant deposit guarantee or investment indemnity schemes, either in Liechtenstein or in the jurisdiction of the Card Issuer.</em></p>\n<p><em>Virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets are not legal tender and are not backed by any government. Unlike fiat currencies, which are regulated and backed by local governments and central banks, virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets are based only on technology and user consensus. In cases of massive manipulations or market panic, central governments will not take any corrective actions or measures to achieve stability, maintain liquidity or protect the value of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets.</em> </p>\n<p><em>There is a possibility that executed orders with respect to certain transactions with virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets cannot be settled or may be difficult to settle, or can be completed only at significantly adverse prices depending on the market situation and/or market volume for certain virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets.</em> </p>\n<p><em>There is also no assurance that TenX will continue to accept the Accepted Assets for purposes of use of the Available Balance to execute your transactions, or that the Card Issuer, Visa or Merchants will continue to permit or accept Card Transactions in the future.</em> </p>\n<p><strong><em>Blockchain Network Risk</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Completion of certain transactions in connection with virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets on blockchains can be deferred for a certain period of time until an adequate number of confirmations has been received. Transactions with Accepted Assets will not be reflected in your account until the adequate number of confirmations has been received and confirmed by TenX. There is a possibility that your TenX Wallet Transactions and Card Transactions (to the extent that they depend on the preceding blockchain-based transactions) may be declined or remain unconfirmed for a period of time. Transactions in connection with virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets may be irreversible, and, accordingly, potential losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some transactions in connection with virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time when you or another party initiated the transaction.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Risk of Using External Wallet Services and Exchange Services</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>In the case where you use an external cryptocurrency wallet or a cryptocurrency wallet which is established or maintained with an Exchange (as defined below) or another service provider where you do not have secure possession of your private keys or credentials to access such cryptocurrency wallet, you may not be able to access your virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets including the Accepted Assets. TenX is under no obligation, and may not be able, to assist you in such case.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Force Majeure</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>There is a risk that your Card Transactions or TenX Wallet Transactions may be affected by system failures resulting from adverse events, natural disasters and other emergencies, as well as unforeseen significant changes in the external environment. With regards to opportunity loss (e.g. loss of opportunity to place a payment instruction, resulting in loss of profits which could have been obtained) due to occurrences such as emergency situations and Force Majeure events, TenX and/or the Card Issuer are under no obligation to take any corrective action or measure.</em>  </p>\n<p><strong><em>Regulatory Uncertainty</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>The regulatory frameworks applicable to payment services providers and transactions in connection with virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets are still developing and evolving. It is possible that your Card Transactions or TenX Wallet Transactions are, or may be in the future, subject to various reporting, tax or other liabilities and obligations.  Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the country, regional (for example, in the EU or an EEA) or international level may materially and adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets.</em></p>\n<p><strong>YOU AND TENX HEREBY AGREE AS FOLLOWS:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>1.1 In these Terms, the following words and expressions shall have the following meanings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1.1.1 “<strong>AML</strong>” means anti-money laundering. </li>\n<li>1.1.2 “<strong>Accepted Assets</strong>” means such virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets as may be compatible with and supported by the TenX App and the TenX Account, with the list of such virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets being as set out in Annex 1 hereto and subject to change from time to time by TenX at its sole and absolute discretion.</li>\n<li>1.1.3 “<strong>Applicable Exchange Rate</strong>” means such exchange rate representing the value (in the relevant fiat currency or in the relevant cryptocurrency units) of each unit of an Accepted Asset as may be determined by TenX to be applicable for purposes of calculating the amount of the Available Balance of a TenX Account, displaying for you the prices of the Accepted Assets, applicable fees or charges, and the values of a Card Transaction where the card transactions are directly preceding or dependent on the successful completion of the blockchain-based transactions.

You will also be able to access a downloadable report via your TenX Account, including all fees payable by and charged to you in the relevant period. TenX reserves the right to charge a fee for providing you with any additional information or for providing the transaction history and other information (other than via downloadable standard reports). The way in which TenX and/or the Card Issuer provide such information will allow you to store and reproduce the information unchanged, for example by printing a copy. TenX will ensure that the details of each transaction will be made available for you to view online for at least thirteen (13) months from the execution date.</li>\n<li>\n<p>4.3 The TenX Services may include parts thereof which allow you to create, post, upload, share or store content, including, but not limited to, photos, videos, sound, text, graphics, code, items or other information and materials (collectively, your “User Content”).

You are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any User Content you create, post, upload, share or store in or through any part of the TenX Services at your sole cost and expense.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>RIGHTS TO FEEDBACK AND USER CONTENT</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>5.1 To the maximum extent permitted by the applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements, TenX shall be entitled to retrieve and collect, and you hereby affirmatively agree, consent to and authorise the collection, use and disclosure by and on behalf of TenX, any Feedback provided by you to TenX or User Content created, posted, uploaded, shared or stored by you in connection with any part of the TenX Services. TenX shall be entitled to collect, use or disclose any Feedback provided by you to TenX and any User Content created, posted, uploaded, shared or stored by you in connection with any part of the TenX Services for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you.</li>\n<li>5.2 You agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by the applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements, TenX shall be entitled to retain all Feedback and User Content it receives for any purpose which it deems fit. </li>\n<li>5.3 You agree to grant TenX a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable and fully sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform and publicly display all Feedback and User Content for any purpose which TenX deems fit (including the copying, transaction, distribution and publication thereof).

You may also be prompted to answer several security questions. </li>\n<li>6.3 You shall have the sole responsibility to maintain the secrecy and secure possession of all of your Credentials. You should not disclose your Credentials to any person other than representatives of TenX. While representatives of TenX may request for only information or documents for purposes of verifying your identity and address, they will never request for your password and any other access keys for accessing your TenX Account or the cryptocurrency wallet associated therewith. Accordingly, any email, telephone call or other communication requesting for your password and any other access keys for accessing your TenX Account or the cryptocurrency wallet associated therewith, should be treated as unauthorised and suspicious, and notified to TenX. * 6.4 If you do share your Credentials with a third party for any reason, including for the reason that the third party has promised to provide you with additional services such as account aggregation or information services, such third party will have access to and use your TenX Account, the Customer Information provided by you to TenX and your Card. You may also be responsible for any other actions taken by such third party using your Credentials. Granting permission to any third party in any way does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities, obligations and liabilities under these Terms or the Card Issuer Terms. </li>\n<li>6.5 Any claim with respect to lost or compromised credentials to your TenX Account, lost Card, an unauthorised or defective execution of a payments or e-money transaction included into your transaction history or other reports or the non-execution of a payments or e-money transaction or blockchain transactions must be submitted by you to the TenX support team <strong>immediately via Support section are www.tenx.tech</strong> to ensure that TenX is able to take appropriate actions, reset your credentials and protect your account and the integrity of our services, and in any case within 30 days of the incident, unauthorised execution or non-execution of transaction, as the case may be. Where you know or suspect that your Card has been lost or compromised, you must immediately access your TenX Account, block or lock your Card and disable all uses of your Card and your TenX Account for any further transactions.</li>\n<li>6.6 In case a claim is lodged by you within the time specified in the previous paragraph, TenX will conduct an investigation, and if the fact of a payment or e-money transaction not being authorised is confirmed, TenX shall refund you with the amount of the relevant transaction no later than by the end of the following Business Day after noting or being notified of the transaction and, where applicable, restore the debited account to the state in which it would have been, had the unauthorised transaction not occurred. However, this obligation shall not apply where TenX has reasonable grounds for suspecting fraud. Where required, you shall promptly take such steps as may be prescribed by TenX and/or the Card Issuer in relation to lost or compromised credentials or unauthorised transactions, including making of a police report accompanied by written confirmation or other actions or submissions that TenX and/or the Card Issuer may require. </li>\n<li>\n<p>6.7 You shall, however, remain liable for any loss resulting from an unauthorised payment or e-money transaction under the following circumstances and subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a) Until notification to TenX pursuant to the rules on notification of an incident, of the loss or theft, or misuse of the Credentials which was made possible because you were unable to preserve the security of your Credentials:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you remain liable up to an amount of EUR 50, unless the loss, theft or misappropriation was not detectable to you prior to a payment, except you have acted fraudulently;</li>\n<li>the loss was caused by acts or lack of action of an employee, agent or branch of TenX or of an entity to which its activities were outsourced.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>b) You will bear all of the losses relating to any unauthorised payment or e-money transactions if they were incurred by you acting fraudulently or failing to fulfil one or more of the obligations relating to these Terms with intent or gross negligence. In that case, the maximum amount referred to above will not apply.</li>\n<li>c) Where TenX did not require strong Client authentication for payments or e-money transactions, you will not bear any financial losses unless you acted fraudulently.</li>\n<li>d) You shall not bear any financial consequences resulting from fraudulent or unauthorised use of the lost, stolen or misappropriated Credentials after you have duly notified TenX, except where you have acted fraudulently.</li>\n<li>e) In any case, you shall bear the entirety of the losses resulting from an unauthorised transaction in the event that you have acted fraudulently, irrespective of the notification of an incident sent to us.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>6.8 <strong>No Returns or Refunds for Blockchain-based transactions.</strong> All blockchain-based transactions are final and non-reversible.  We do not accept any returns or provide refunds in connection with any such transactions. While a blockchain-based transaction is pending confirmation by the applicable network, the virtual currency or cryptographic token or a digital asset subject to such confirmation, will be unavailable for use in connection with any other transaction you initiate with TenX Services.</li>\n<li>6.9 If you use your TenX account primarily for business purposes, please refer to the following conditions that apply to you. If you are not a consumer (which means that the TenX Account is primarily and regularly used by you for the purpose of carrying out entrepreneurial or professional activities, business or trade) we will consider you to be a business customer or “Business Account” and it is hereby agreed that in accordance with Articles 38 and 61 of the EU Payment Services Directive, the legal provisions relating to payments and e-money services the application of which may be excluded by contract in the relationships between a service provider and a non-consumer will not apply to our business relationship. Accordingly, you agree in particular that the provisions of Title III, Articles 62 (1), 64 (3), 72, 74, 76, 77, 80 and 89 of the EU Payment Services Directive do not apply and that time limits that are different from those laid down in Article 71 of the EU Payment Services Directive apply.</li>\n<li>\n<p>6.10 If your account is a Business Account, you hereby agree as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a) you may be charged fees in a larger number of situations, including with respect to the provision of information, corrective and preventive measures as further set out in our fees schedule;</li>\n<li>b) in case of unauthorised transactions, you will not benefit from the provisions of Article 74 of the EU Payment Services Directive as reflected in article 6.6 of these Terms, which shall be disapplied, meaning inter alia that you will bear all losses incurred before notification of an incident to us and that you will bear all losses even after notification where you have acted negligently or fraudulently;</li>\n<li>c) you are not entitled to the right to a refund for certain payments or e-money transactions initiated by or through a payee as provided for in Article 76 and 77 of the EU Payment Services Directive;</li>\n<li>d) you will not benefit from the rules of the Article 72 of the EU Payment Services Directive, and you will need to provide evidence of any of your allegations, including that you have not authorised a transaction or that a transaction was not correctly executed.</li>\n<li>e) you further agree that while we may do so, we are not obliged to comply nor provide you with the information requirements set out in Title III of EU Payment Services Directive.</li>\n<li>f) TenX liability for the losses or damages you may suffer in cases of compromised or lost credentials or unauthorised transactions will be limited to the widest extent admissible by laws and regulations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>6.11 As required by applicable regulations, TenX will notify you in the event of suspected or actual fraud or security threats via your registered e-mail, phone number or mobile app notification.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>"}}},{"__typename":"ContentfulTextBlock","contentful_id":"hPa5xtkDkytm1SPgWQmt3","node_locale":"en","display":null,"alignContent":null,"backgroundColor":null,"mobileBehavior":null,"text":{"__typename":"contentfulTextBlockTextTextNode","childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<ul>\n<li>\n<p>6-A <strong>DISPUTED CARD TRANSACTIONS</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>6-A.1  Subect to the Card Issuer Terms, in the event that TenX is notified by you of any Card Transaction which you discover, suspect or have reason to believe to be arising from or in connection with any loss, theft, or inappropriate or unauthorised disclosure of and/or use of your Card and/or your Credentials in relation to your Card, or any manifest or obvious technical error at any stage of a Card Transaction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a) TenX shall provide to the Card Issuer all relevant information in relation to such Card Transaction and other Customer Information provided by you to TenX for the purposes of allowing the Card Issuer to investigate such Card Transaction;</li>\n<li>b) provided that the Card Issuer is satisfied that you have made all reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute in relation to such Card Transaction with the Merchant with which such Card Transaction was made, the Card Issuer shall investigate such Card Transaction and determine, whether or not your refund request is justified; </li>\n<li>c) during the period of such investigation, the amount of Accepted Assets of your Available Balance which is the subject of such Card Transaction shall be unavailable for use in connection with any other TenX Wallet Transaction or Card Transaction; and</li>\n<li>d) in the case where the Card Issuer determines to provide a refund of the value of such Card Transaction, TenX shall provide a refund to your TenX Account of the deducted amount of Accepted Assets of your Available Balance which is subject to such Card Transaction.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>6-A.2 Subject to the Card Issuer Terms, in the case where TenX and/or the Card Issuer receive(s) additional information in relation to such Card Transaction, after a refund of the deducted amount of the amount of Accepted Assets of your Available Balance has already been provided to you and the Card Issuer determines, based on such additional information, that you shall not be entitled to receive such refund, the refunded amount of Accepted Assets of your Available Balance shall be re-deducted from your Available Balance. In the event that your Available Balance is insufficient for such re-deduction, you agree to reimburse TenX, upon request, for the value of the Card Transaction in excess of your Available Balance in such fiat currency, Accepted Asset or any other form as may be requested by TenX.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>6-B. <strong>MONEY PAID INTO YOUR ACCOUNT BY ACCIDENT</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>6-B.1 Subject to the applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements and the Policies (including the Privacy Policy), TenX can already return money paid to your payment instrument by mistake. </li>\n<li>6-B.2 However, if you don't think a payment made to you from a payment service provider in the EEA was a mistake, TenX may also be allowed to share your personal information with the paying payment service provider so that you can be contacted directly. This is because TenX is required to cooperate with other payment service providers and share all relevant information in order to assist with tracing money which is sent to the wrong person.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>6-C. <strong>MONEY PAID BY YOU TO THE WRONG PERSON</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>6-C.1 If you give TenX the wrong details for a payment or you tell TenX about an incorrect payment more than 13 months after it was made, TenX won't give you a refund but will try and trace it for you.

This could be the case for payments you make at hotels or at fuel stations for example.</li>\n<li>6-D.2 TenX shall release any blocked funds without undue delay as soon as TenX is aware of the exact amount of the payment transaction and immediately after receipt of the relevant payment order.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>6-E. <strong>LATE EXECUTION OF PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>6-E.1 If you are able to make payments directly from your account to another person and if a payment you asked TenX to make within the EEA arrives later than it should have, you can ask TenX to contact the receiving bank and ask them to treat it as if it was made on time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>6-F. <strong>THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>6-F.1 You can choose to allow a Third Party Provider (TPP) to access information on your account, to combine and display information about your account with information from accounts you have with other payment service providers, and, if applicable to your payment instrument, to make payments for you from your account, provided the TPP is authorised by the FMA in Liechtenstein, FCA in the UK, or another European regulator and you have given your explicit consent. </li>\n<li>6-F.2 If you do, you must keep us informed of any incorrect or unauthorised transactions that happen so TenX can take steps to stop further misuse of your payment instrument and arrange any refund you've been entitled to.</li>\n<li>6-F.3 If you are thinking of using a TPP, it is important you check with the regulator whether it is authorised before you use it. </li>\n<li>6-F.4 TenX can refuse or stop access to a TPP if TenX is concerned it isn’t authorised or if TenX believes it's fraudulent or acting fraudulently. If that happens, TenX will contact you to explain why unless TenX believes that would compromise our security or it would be unlawful. </li>\n<li>6-F.5 This provision will not affect any customers who do not use TPPs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>7 <strong>USE BY TENX OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>7.1 Subject to the applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements and the Policies (including the Privacy Policy), TenX shall be entitled to request, retrieve and collect, and you hereby affirmatively agree, consent to and authorise the collection, retrieval, use and disclosure by and on behalf of TenX of any and all Customer Information, in the manner and for the purposes set out in the Policies and the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a) carrying out identification checks, due diligence and other checks, screenings and verifications (including for purposes of completing any anti-fraud, know-your-client, CFT and AML procedures implemented by TenX);</li>\n<li>b) dealing in any matters relating to your Card or your TenX Account (including the mailing of correspondence, statements, invoices, reports or notices to you, which could involve disclosure of your Customer Information to the extent necessary to bring about delivery of the same as well as on the external cover of envelopes/mail packages); </li>\n<li>c) investigating fraud, misconduct, any unlawful action or omission, whether relating to your claims or any other matter relating to your Card, your TenX Account and/or your relationship with TenX, and whether or not there is any suspicious of the aforementioned;</li>\n<li>d) for meeting legal, regulatory and other compliance requirements (including disclosure to all government agencies and authorities, regulators, exchanges, clearing houses, markets or depositories); and</li>\n<li>e) providing you with information about your transactions, updating you about our services, for example, scheduled maintenance times or security alerts, maintaining safety and security of our services, and other purposes as set out in these Terms and our Policies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>8 <strong>USE OF TENX SERVICES AND TRANSACTION EXECUTION</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>8.1 When you instruct TenX to process and complete a transaction, you agree and accept that you authorise TenX to execute such transaction immediately (unless otherwise stated) in accordance with your instructions and charge you any applicable fees associated therewith. You represent and warrant that any Customer Information you provide to TenX in connection with each transaction, is accurate and complete.  </li>\n<li>8.2 You further agree and accept that any duly authorised instruction by you to TenX to process and complete a transaction cannot be reversed, changed, withdrawn or cancelled, unless such reversal, change, withdrawal or cancellation is practicable and specifically permitted by the applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements. </li>\n<li>8.3 You may issue a payment instruction to us by connecting to our Services and making appropriate selections and entering relevant transactional details as well as validating your transaction through your preferred method of strong authentication, where applicable.  The sole transmission to TenX of a payment instruction in the above described manner shall constitute an authorization of such payment instruction. The validation of a payment instruction through the use of the Services shall have the same value as your original signature and shall have the same value in evidence as an original written document. </li>\n<li>8.4 If the strong authentication confirmation has been successfully completed, the burden of proof that an executed transaction has not been authorised by you or that a transaction has not been correctly executed normally lies with you. </li>\n<li>8.5 A payment instruction shall be deemed to have been received by TenX at the time of actual validation by you of the payment instruction, it being understood that, depending on the payment instrument used, certain payment instructions or validation thereof received by TenX after the cut-off times imposed by our banking or payment partners, or at any time during a non-Business Day, will be deemed to have been received on the next Business Day.</li>\n<li>8.6 When payment transactions (including also transactions with e-money balance) are made in euros from an Available Balance denominated in euros, we will ensure that the amount of the transaction is credited to the account of the payment service provider of the payee by no later than the end of the following Business Day following the moment of receipt of the payment instruction in accordance with these Terms. For all other payment transactions effected within the EEA other than the payment transaction described in the preceding paragraph, TenX will ensure that the amount of the payment transaction is credited to the account of the payment service provider of the payee by no later than the fourth Business Day following the moment of receipt of the Payment instruction. For all other payment transactions not covered in the preceding paragraphs, you acknowledge that the execution time for the payment transaction will be subject to the operating rules of international payment systems and that in this case, we will not be bound by the deadlines set out above. </li>\n<li>8.7 In the event that we do not detect a fraudulent use or misuse of your Credentials and execute a payment transaction initiated through such Credentials, including successful application of the strong authentication requirements, as the case may be, we shall, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct, be deemed to have validly executed the payment transaction, as if the payment transaction had been initiated by you. We will thus be released from our obligation to refund you the funds on the TenX Account which have been used in order to execute such payment instruction.</li>\n<li>\n<p>8.8 We may, at any time, reject a payment instruction submitted to us via the Services, or impose any other conditions or restrictions upon your use of the Services. The reasons for the refusal and the procedure for correcting any factual mistakes that led to the refusal will be notified to you at the latest by the end of the Business Day following the refusal. TenX will be deemed to have satisfied this obligation if it has sent the notification of refusal within the period of execution time regardless of the date of actual receipt by you of such notification. Any notification by TenX of a justified refusal of a payment instruction may result in you being charged a fee.</p>\n<p>TenX may, without being obliged to do so, refuse to execute a payment instruction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a) if the payment instruction contains any factual error, in particular, incomplete or imprecise transactional details;</li>\n<li>b) if you have breached any of your obligations towards TenX under these Terms or any other agreement entered into between you and TenX;</li>\n<li>c) if the payment instruction does not meet the agreed form as set out in these Terms;</li>\n<li>d) if your Available Balance is insufficient to execute a payment instruction in full;</li>\n<li>e) if the spending limits as may have been agreed upon between you and TenX have been reached;</li>\n<li>f) if the payment instruction cannot be executed in full;</li>\n<li>g) if the payment instruction has been made by a person who has no power to operate the Account;</li>\n<li>h) if TenX is legally or contractually obliged to freeze your Account or block transactions;</li>\n<li>i) if TenX suspects that the security of Service is compromised, e.g. because of a problem or technical failure or because of hacking attacks;</li>\n<li>j) if TenX suspects fraud (for example where it has identified suspicious transaction(s)) or has received a notification that an incident has occurred);</li>\n<li>k) if TenX believes that the execution of the payment transaction would be contrary to any national or foreign laws, regulations or decisions of authorities or would expose TenX to liability risks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Should you elect to proceed with a subsequent execution of a payment instruction notwithstanding refusal thereof by TenX, you shall provide TenX with a new payment instruction containing all the required elements. It will not be possible to correct the initial payment instruction.</p>\n<p>In the event of a payment instruction which is beyond your Account’s permissible use or applicable limits, TenX may request additional identifying information from you and must receive such information before processing the payment instruction. If you fail to provide this additional required information or documentation, the attempted transaction may be refused or suspended by TenX, without being obliged to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>8.9 TenX may, at any time and to the maximum permitted by the applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements, pause, refuse to process or complete any TenX transaction initiated by you, impose limits on the value or type of such transaction or impose any other conditions or restrictions on your access to and use of the TenX Services.  </li>\n<li>8.10 It shall be your sole responsibility to keep track of and monitor your activity for TenX Wallet Transactions or Card Transactions. In particular, it shall be your sole responsibility to ensure that your Available Balance is sufficient to cover the full amount required for a proposed transaction and all fees associated therewith which shall be payable by and charged to you upon initiation of a transaction. </li>\n<li>8.11 If you attempt to initiate, or if TenX is instructed by you to process or complete, a transaction at a time when your Available Balance is insufficient to cover the full amount required for such transaction and all fees associated therewith which shall be payable by you, such transaction in most instances will be declined. However, in the event that due to a system malfunction or any other reason, such transaction is successful or completed (or partially successful or completed) notwithstanding that your Available Balance is insufficient and your Available Balance becomes negative as a result of such successful or complete transaction, you agree to reimburse TenX, upon request, for the amount of the transaction in excess of your Available Balance in such fiat currency, Accepted Asset or any other form as may be requested by TenX.</li>\n<li>8.12 It is your sole responsibility to confirm the list of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets which are Accepted Assets. Any virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets other than the Accepted Assets (the “<strong>Unsupported Assets</strong>”) which are sent to an address associated with your TenX Account may be lost, destroyed or not returned to you. While you may request for TenX’s assistance to retrieve any such Unsupported Assets which are sent to an address associated with your TenX Account, TenX is under no obligation to provide such assistance. Additionally, there may be fees payable by and chargeable to you if TenX provides any such assistance to retrieve the Unsupported Assets for return to you. </li>\n<li>8.13 In the event of any airdrop, fork, hack, mining attack (including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), cyber-attack, distributed denials of service, error, vulnerability, defect, flaw in programming or source code or any other occurrence resulting in a change in the structure or source code of any blockchain, any determination of whether or not to take any corrective action or measure and the type of corrective action or measure shall be made at the sole and absolute discretion of the TenX. TenX does not bear any liability in the event that you or a third party incurs any losses as a result of any airdrop, fork, hack, mining attack (including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), cyber-attack, distributed denials of service, error, vulnerability, defect, flaw in programming or source code or any other occurrence resulting in a change in the structure or source code of any blockchain, or lack of corrective actions or measures taken by TenX or if TenX decides to cease its support of Accepted Assets with the TenX App.</li>\n<li>8.14 To the maximum extent permitted by all applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements, TenX shall be entitled, at any time in its sole and absolute discretion, to determine and vary the types of transactions that may be carried out with your TenX Account, the types of services offered to you, the payment methods supported or the list of Merchants which are participating in the relevant card scheme and programme administered by TenX and/or the Card Issuer and under which the Card Issuer operates.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>8-A. <strong><em>STATEMENTS</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>8-A.1 Information about your payment instrument and transactional history will be made available to you at all times via your online account without an accompanying email notification. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>9 <strong>PROLONGED INACTIVITY</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>9.1 In the event of very prolonged period of inactivity in respect of your TenX Account and where the Available Balance of your TenX Account is positive, TenX shall attempt to contact you with such contact details based on the Customer Information provided by you to TenX. However, if TenX is unable to contact you, the applicable laws, rules, regulations, directions, orders or requirements may require TenX to report such Available Balance as unclaimed property to the applicable regulatory authority or law enforcement body and deliver the Accepted Assets comprising such Available Balance to the applicable jurisdiction as unclaimed property. To the maximum extent permitted by all applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements, TenX reserves the right to deduct administrative fees from such Available Balance in connection with such prolonged period of inactivity, such attempt to contact you and/or such report.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>10 <strong>RESPONSIBILITY FOR USE OF EXTERNAL WALLETS AND EXTERNAL ACCOUNTS</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>10.1 You shall be solely responsible for your use of any External Wallet or External Account and your compliance with any and all terms and conditions which are prescribed by the provider of the services of such External Wallet or Account as being applicable to your use of such services.
