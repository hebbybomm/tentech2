        IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON KEY RISKS
    </h2>
    <p>
        This section of these Terms highlights some of the risks associated with
        transactions in connection with virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens
        and/or other digital assets such as those which are the Accepted Assets,
        payments services and other risks which TenX would like you to consider
        before accepting these Terms and using any part of the TenX Services. You
        are solely responsible for understanding and complying with any and all
        applicable laws, rules and regulations in connection with your acceptance
        of these Terms and your use of any part of the TenX Services, including but
        not limited to those related to taxes or foreign currency transactions as
        well as reporting and disclosure obligations. To the best of the knowledge
        and belief of TenX, all risk factors which are material to you in making an
        informed judgement as to whether to accept these Terms and use any part of
        the TenX Services have been set out below. However, the list of risk
        factors set out below is only a non-exhaustive list for your consideration,
        and other risks, arising either now or in the future, could additionally be
        relevant and applicable to you in making an informed judgement as to
        whether to accept, or continue to accept, these Terms and/or use, or
        continue to use, the TenX Services.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">
        <em>Risk of Funds Not Being Immediately Available</em>
    </h3>
    <p>
        TenX may close, suspend, or limit your access to any part of the TenX
        Services (as defined below), and/or restrict your access to the Available
        Balance (as defined below) of your TenX Wallet Account (as defined below)
        for so long as reasonably required to protect against the risk of liability
        if you violate, breach or fail to comply with any part of these Terms, the
        Card Issuer Terms and the Policies (as defined below). For the avoidance of
        doubt, TenX may also permanently close, suspend, or limit your access to
        the TenX Services if you violate, breach or fail to comply with any part of
        these Terms, the Card Issuer Terms and the Policies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that your TenX Wallet Account has two (2) separate and distinct
        functionalities, which are the payment functionality and the reserve
        functionality. Your ability to access the Available Balance for purposes of
        making a Card Transaction or TenX Wallet Transaction (each as defined
        below) using the Available Balance of your TenX Wallet Account will depend
        upon whether the Available Balance (which is the subject of such
        transaction) is associated with the payment functionality or the reserve
        functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the purposes of these Terms:
    </p>
    <p>
        (a) The element of your TenX Wallet Account which constitutes the payment
        functionality is known as the "<strong>payment account</strong>". Such
        payment account is the operational part of your TenX Wallet Account through
        which you have access to your Available Balance and which can be used for
        the execution of Card Transactions or TenX Wallet Transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) The element of your TenX Wallet Account which constitutes the reserve
        functionality is known as the "<strong>reserve</strong>". Your access to
        the reserve is restricted and you have no ability to use the Available
        Balance held in the reserve or to execute TenX Wallet Transactions or Card
        Transactions using the Available Balance held in the reserve. Any Available
        Balance held in the reserve may be marked or categorised, for example, as
        "pending", "under review", "risk reserve" or other similar indications or
        categorisations. The temporary holding of Available Balance in such reserve
        by TenX is related to TenX’s and/or the Card Issuer’s assessment and
        determination, at its sole and absolute discretion, of certain AML, CFT,
        fraud, financial and other regulatory risks.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">
        <em>Payment Execution Risks</em>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Please note that following TenX’s receipt of your payment order or
        instructions to proceed with a transaction in connection with the Accepted
        Assets (as defined below), TenX will process or execute such transaction
        (and where applicable, also credit the relevant payment service provider)
        as quickly as the relevant payment schemes and financial networks allow
        (and such transaction may be completed by the next business day following
        the date of TenX’s receipt of your payment order or instructions).
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">
        <em>Price Change Risk Associated with Using Virtual Currencies</em>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Prices of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital
        assets fluctuate day by day or even hour by hour. The value of your
        Available Balance could surge or drop suddenly. Please note that there is a
        possibility that the price of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens
        and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets could drop to zero.
        Prices of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital
        assets are prone to significant fluctuations, for example, due to announced
        proposed legislative acts, governmental restrictions, news related to
        cyber-crimes or other factors causing potentially excessive market
        enthusiasm or disproportionate loss in confidence. Prices of virtual
        currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets can also be
        manipulated.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">
        <em>Liquidity Risk and the Nature of Virtual Currencies</em>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Your TenX Wallet Account and the Available Balance of your TenX Wallet
        Account are not protected by the relevant deposit guarantee or investment
        indemnity schemes in the jurisdiction(s) of TenX or the Card Issuer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such
        as those which are the Accepted Assets are not legal tender and are not
        backed by any government. Unlike fiat currencies, which are regulated and
        backed by local governments and central banks, virtual currencies,
        cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as those which are
        the Accepted Assets may be based only on technology and user consensus. In
        cases of massive manipulations or market panic, central governments will
        not take any corrective actions or measures to achieve stability, maintain
        liquidity or protect the value of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens
        and/or other digital assets such as those which are the Accepted Assets.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a possibility that executed orders with respect to certain trades
        of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets
        such as those which are the Accepted Assets cannot be settled or may be
        difficult to settle, or can be completed only at significantly adverse
        prices depending on the market situation and/or market volume for certain
        virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such
        as those which are the Accepted Assets.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is also no assurance that TenX will continue to accept the Accepted
        Assets for purposes of use of the Available Balance to carry out TenX
        Wallet Transactions or Card Transactions, or that the Card Issuer, the
        relevant card network or Merchants will continue to permit Card
        Transactions, in the future.
    </p>

    <h3 align="center">
        <em>Blockchain Network Risk</em>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Completion of certain transactions in connection with virtual currencies,
        cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as those which are
        the Accepted Assets on blockchains can be deferred for a certain period of
        time until an adequate number of confirmations has been received. A TenX
        Wallet Transaction or a Card Transaction (to the extent that it is
        blockchain-based) will not be reflected in your TenX Wallet Account until
        such adequate number of confirmations has been received and confirmed by
        TenX. There is a possibility that your TenX Wallet Transactions and Card
        Transactions (to the extent that they are blockchain-based) may be
        cancelled or remain unconfirmed on blockchains. Transactions in connection
        with virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets
        such as those which are the Accepted Assets may be irreversible, and,
        accordingly, Losses (as defined below) due to fraudulent or accidental
        transactions may not be recoverable. Some transactions in connection with
        virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such
        as those which are the Accepted Assets shall be deemed to be made when
        recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time when
        you or another party initiated the transaction.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">
        <em>Risk of Using External Wallet Services and Exchange Services</em>
    </h3>
    <p>
        In the case where you use an external cryptocurrency wallet or a
        cryptocurrency wallet which is established or maintained with an Exchange
        (as defined below) and you do not have secure possession of your private
        key or credentials to access such cryptocurrency wallet, you may not be
        able to access your virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other
        digital assets including those which are Accepted Assets. TenX is also
        under no obligation, and may not be able, to assist you in such case.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
            <em>Risk of Using TenX Wallet Account and TenX Wallet App</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        While TenX is committed to high standards for maintaining the security of
        all private keys to the cryptocurrency wallets associated with TenX Wallet
        Accounts, TenX is not responsible and is not liable for any Loss resulting
        from any loss, theft, or inappropriate or unauthorised disclosure of and/or
        use of the private keys to the cryptocurrency wallet associated with your
        TenX Wallet Account where such loss, theft, or inappropriate or
        unauthorised disclosure of and/or use is not within the control of TenX.
        TenX is also under no obligation to take any corrective action or measure
        in the event of any such loss, theft, or inappropriate or unauthorised
        disclosure of and/or use.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">
        <em>Force Majeure </em>
    </h3>
    <p>
        There is a risk that your Card Transactions or TenX Wallet Transactions may
        be affected by system failures resulting from adverse events, natural
        disasters and other emergencies and unforeseen significant changes in the
        external environment. With regard to any Loss due to occurrences such as
        emergency situations and Force Majeure events, TenX and/or the Card Issuer
        is/are under no obligation to take any corrective action or measure.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">
        <em>Regulatory Uncertainty</em>
    </h3>
    <p>
        The regulatory frameworks applicable to payment services providers and
        transactions in connection with virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens
        and/or other digital assets such as those which are the Accepted Assets are
        still developing and in a state of flux. It is possible that your Card
        Transactions or TenX Wallet Transactions are, or may be in the future,
        subject to various reporting, tax or other liabilities and obligations.
        Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the country, regional (for
        example, in the EU or an EEA) or international level may materially and
        adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of virtual
        currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as those
        which are the Accepted Assets.

        to TenX with high standards of information security.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.2. Your email address, your Credentials, other Customer Information which
        you provide to TenX and certain additional authentication methods will be
        used to access the TenX Services (including your TenX Wallet Account and

        Paragraph 28 below. You may also be prompted to answer several security
        questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.3 You shall have the sole responsibility to maintain the secrecy and
        secure possession of all of your Credentials. You should not disclose your
        Credentials to any person other than representatives of TenX. While
        representatives of TenX may request for only information or documents for
        purposes of verifying your identity and address, they will never request
        for your password and any other access keys for accessing your TenX Wallet
        Account or the cryptocurrency wallet associated therewith, or your Card
        number, your card verification value (CVV) or card verification code (CVC).

        Account or the cryptocurrency wallet associated therewith, or your Card
        number, your card verification value (CVV) or card verification code (CVC)

        including for the reason that the third party has promised to provide you
        with additional services such as account aggregation or information
        services, such third party will have access to and use your TenX Wallet
        Account, the Customer Information provided by you to TenX and your Card.
        You may also be responsible for any other actions taken by such third party
        using your Credentials. Granting permission to any third party in any way
        does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities, obligations and
        liabilities under these Terms or the Card Issuer Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.4 In the event that you discover, suspect or have reason to believe that

        disclosure of and/or use of your Card, your TenX Wallet Account and/or your
        Credentials, you shall immediately:
    </p>
    <p>
        (a) notify TenX of such TenX Wallet Transaction or Card Transaction (as the
        case may be), such loss, theft, inappropriate or unauthorised disclosure,
        access or use and provide such other Customer Information as may be
        requested by TenX in relation to such TenX Wallet Transaction or Card
        Transaction (as the case may be) in accordance with Paragraph 28 below; and
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) through the TenX Wallet App, access your TenX Wallet Account, block or
        lock your Card and disable all uses of your Card and your TenX Wallet
        Account for any further transactions.

    <p>
        Where required, you shall promptly take such steps as may be prescribed by
        TenX and/or the Card Issuer in relation to such loss, theft, inappropriate
        or unauthorised disclosure, access or use, including the making of a police
        report accompanied by written confirmation of such loss, theft,
        inappropriate or unauthorised disclosure, access or use and any other
        information that TenX and/or the Card Issuer may require.

    <p>
        6.5 Subject to these Terms and to the maximum extent permitted by all
        applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements
        (including the Directive and the Directive Transpositions), TenX shall be
        entitled to deduct the Available Balance of your TenX Wallet Account for
        all Card Transactions and/or TenX Wallet Transactions carried out before

        the case may be) or such loss, theft, inappropriate or unauthorised
        disclosure, access or use in accordance with Paragraph 28 below, even if
        such transactions were carried out without your authorisation. 
    </p>
    <p>
        6.6 You hereby acknowledge and agree that you shall have no right(s),
        claim(s) or cause(s) of action in any form or manner against TenX in the
        event of any loss, theft, or inappropriate or unauthorised disclosure of

        for, and will indemnify TenX from, any Loss of TenX arising from the
        actions or inactions of an unauthorised third party in connection with the
        permissions granted by you to such unauthorised third party.

        re-deducted. In the event that your Available Balance is insufficient for
        such re-deduction, you agree to reimburse TenX, upon request, for the value

        10. EXECUTION OF TENX WALLET TRANSACTIONS AND CARD TRANSACTIONS
    </h4>
    <p>
        10.1 When you instruct TenX to process and complete a TenX Wallet
        Transaction or a Card Transaction, you agree and accept that you authorise
        TenX to execute such transaction immediately (unless otherwise stated) in
        accordance with your instructions and, subject to Paragraph 17 below,
        charge you any applicable fees associated therewith. You represent and
        warrant that any Customer Information you provide to TenX in connection
        with a TenX Wallet Transaction or a Card Transaction is accurate and
        complete.
    </p>
    <p>
        10.2 You further agree and accept that any duly authorised instruction by
        you to TenX to process and complete any TenX Wallet Transaction or Card
        Transaction cannot be reversed, changed, withdrawn or cancelled, unless
        such reversal, change, withdrawal or cancellation is reasonably practicable
        and specifically permitted or required by the applicable laws, regulations,
        rules, directions, orders and requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing
        of this Paragraph, TenX reserves the right to take actions or measures in
        relation to any TenX Wallet Transaction or Card Transaction to correct any
        technical and/or system failure and/or error.
    </p>
    <p>
        10.3 Completion of a TenX Wallet Transaction or a Card Transaction (to the
        extent that it is blockchain-based) may be deferred for a certain period of
        time until an adequate number of confirmations have been received on the
        relevant blockchain. During such period of deferment, the amount of the
        Available Balance of your TenX Wallet Account which is subject to such
        confirmations shall be unavailable for use in connection with any other
        TenX Wallet Transaction or Card Transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        10.4 A TenX Wallet Transaction or a Card Transaction (to the extent that it
        is blockchain-based) shall not be deemed to be complete or reflected
        through the Available Balance of your TenX Wallet Account or the relevant
        blockchain until such adequate number of confirmations has been received
        and confirmed by TenX.
    </p>
    <p>
        10.5 TenX may, at any time and to the maximum permitted by the applicable
        laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements, pause,
        refuse to process or complete any TenX Wallet Transaction or Card
        Transaction as instructed by you, impose limits on the value or type of
        such transaction or impose any other conditions or restrictions on your
        access to and use of the TenX Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        10.6 It shall be your sole responsibility to keep track of and monitor your
        activity for TenX Wallet Transactions or Card Transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        10.7 It shall be your sole responsibility to ensure that the Available
        Balance of your TenX Wallet Account is sufficient to cover the full amount
        required for an intended TenX Wallet Transaction or a Card Transaction and
        all fees associated therewith, which shall be payable by you upon
        initiation of a TenX Wallet Transaction or a Card Transaction. It shall
        also be your sole responsibility to ensure that the amount of your Fee
        Payment Assets (being amongst your Accepted Assets) is sufficient to cover
        the full amount required for the payable fees as referred to in Paragraph
        17 below.
    </p>
    <p>
        10.8 If you attempt to initiate, or if TenX is instructed by you to process
        or complete, a transaction at a time when the Available Balance of your
        TenX Wallet Account or the amount of your Fee Payment Assets (being amongst
        your Accepted Assets) is insufficient to cover the full amount required for
        such transaction and all fees associated therewith or the full amount
        required for the payable fees as referred to in Paragraph 17 below (as the
        case may be), such transaction in most instances will be declined. However,
        in the event that due to a system malfunction or any other reason, such
        transaction is successful or completed (or partially successful or
        completed) notwithstanding that the Available Balance of your TenX Wallet
        Account and/or the amount of your Fee Payment Assets (being amongst your
        Accepted Assets) are insufficient for such transaction and all fees
        associated therewith, you agree to reimburse TenX, upon request, for the
        amount of the transaction in excess of your Available Balance and/or the
        amount of payable fees in excess of the amount of the amount of your Fee
        Payment Assets (being amongst your Accepted Assets) in such fiat currency,
        Accepted Asset or any other form as may be requested by TenX. 
    </p>
    <p>
        10.9 It is your sole responsibility to confirm the list of virtual
        currencies, cryptographic tokens, other digital assets and/or fiat
        currencies which are Accepted Assets and Fee Payment Assets. Any virtual
        currencies, cryptographic tokens, other digital assets and/or fiat
    currencies other than the Accepted Assets (the “    <strong>Unsupported Assets</strong>”) which are sent to your TenX Wallet
        Account may be lost, destroyed or not returned to you. While you may
        request for TenX’s assistance to retrieve any such Unsupported Assets which
        are sent to your TenX Wallet Account, TenX is under no obligation to
        provide such assistance. Additionally, there may be fees payable by and
        chargeable to you if TenX provides any such assistance to retrieve the
        Unsupported Assets for return to you. <strong></strong>

        not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and
        “selfish-mining” attacks), cyber-attack, distributed denials of service,
        technical and/or system failure and/or errors, vulnerability, defect, flaw
        in programming or source code or any other occurrence resulting in a change
        in the structure or source code of any blockchain, any determination of
        whether or not to take any corrective action or measure and the type of
        corrective action or measure shall be made at the sole and absolute
        discretion of the TenX. TenX does not bear any liability in the event that
        you or a third party incurs any Losses as a result of any airdrop, fork,
        hack, mining attack (including but not limited to double-spend attacks,
        majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), cyber-attack,
        distributed denials of service, technical and/or system failure and/or
        error, vulnerability, defect, flaw in programming or source code or any
        other occurrence resulting in a change in the structure or source code of
        any blockchain, or lack of corrective actions or measures taken by TenX or
        if TenX decides to cease its support of Accepted Assets with the TenX
        Wallet App.

        and absolute discretion, to determine and vary the types of TenX Wallet
        Transactions and Card Transactions that may be carried out with your TenX
        Wallet Account through the TenX Wallet App and the Card and the list of
        Merchants which are participating in the relevant card scheme and programme

        10.12 Without prejudice to any other provision of these Terms and to the
        maximum extent permitted by all applicable laws, regulations, rules,
        directions, orders and requirements (including the Directive and the
        Directive Transpositions), TenX will treat any grant by you to another
        person of access to your Credentials as your authorisation of use of your
        Card and you will be liable for all TenX Wallet Transactions and Card
        Transactions and fees incurred by such person, and you shall be wholly
        responsible for all such TenX Wallet Transactions and Card Transactions.

        Wallet Account and the Available Balance of your TenX Wallet Account is
        positive, TenX shall attempt to contact you with such contact details based
        on the Customer Information provided by you to TenX. However, if TenX is
        unable to contact you, the applicable laws, rules, regulations, directions,
        orders or requirements may require TenX to report such Available Balance as
        unclaimed property to the applicable regulatory authority or law
        enforcement body and deliver the Accepted Assets comprising such Available
        Balance to the applicable jurisdiction as unclaimed property. To the
        maximum extent permitted by all applicable laws, regulations, rules,
        directions, orders and requirements (including the Directive and the
        Directive Transpositions), TenX reserves the right to deduct such amounts
        of the Available Balance of your TenX Wallet Account for administrative
        fees in connection with such prolonged period of inactivity, such attempt
        to contact you and/or such report.

        Transaction, TenX shall be authorised to initiate debit or credit entries
        to your TenX Wallet Account (or any payment instrument or bank account
        connected thereto) to correct such error, provided that any such correction
        is subject to all applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders
        and requirements (including the Directive and the Directive
        Transpositions). You agree and accept that if TenX is unable to debit your
        TenX Wallet Account (or any payment instrument or any bank account
        connected thereto) for any reason, TenX shall be authorised to resubmit the
        debit, plus any applicable fees, to any other bank account or payment

        the amounts calculated based on such Applicable Exchange Rate at the time
        of actual processing and settlement of the payment of such fees by TenX.
    </p>
    <p>
        17.10 In the case where there is more than one (1) Fee Payment Asset which

        shall have the right to determine, in its sole and absolute discretion,
        that the amount of fees payable in a Fee Payment Asset differs from, or may

        fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by having their initial
        TenX Wallet Accounts closed and registering for new TenX Wallet Accounts,
        or having their Card terminated and applying for a new Card. However, the

        chargeable to you in connection with such termination, and unless you
        notify TenX of your disagreement with your payment of such amounts of fees
        within five (5) days from the date of your receipt of the notice given by
        TenX, you shall be deemed to have agreed to payment of such amounts of fees
        and have authorised TenX to deduct such amounts of the Available Balance of
