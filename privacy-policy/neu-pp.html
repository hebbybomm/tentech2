            party, including such information set out in Section 2 below. TenX takes
            the processing of your information very seriously and will use your
            information only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. It is

            policy. We will post the notice on our website followed by a notification

                <p>
                In order to complete our customer screening and identity verification
                process, including checks in relation to fraud detection and
                prevention, anti-money laundering, know-your-client and countering of

                the TenX Group, payment partners, service providers and fraud agencies
                as well as information available through internet and publicly
                accessible social network data. In the course of such verification, we
                will collect information on your political opinions, records on past
                criminal jurisdictions and whether you are a politically exposed person
                or included in any sanction list.
              </p>

            <li>

                <strong>Confirmations and additional information:</strong>
                <p>
                If we cannot verify the information that you provide, we may ask you to
                upload or send us additional confirmations or to answer additional
                questions online to help verify your information.
                </p>
                <p>
              If you send or receive high overall payment volumes or display
                inconsistent transactional patterns through the TenX Services, or if
                you have a limited transactional history with us, we will conduct a
                background check on you by obtaining information about you and/or your
                business, and potentially (if legally permitted) also about your
                directors, shareholders and partners, from a credit reference or fraud
                agency referred to above. If you owe us money, we may obtain additional
                information about you from a fraud agency, to the extent permitted by
                law. TenX, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to periodically
                retrieve and review a business and/or consumer credit report supplied
                by such credit reference or fraud agency for any account, and reserves
                the right to close an account based on information obtained during this
                credit review process.

            When you use the TenX Services using any device (whether connected to TenX

            and store device sign-on data (including but not limited to device ID) and

            If we allow you to link your membership of an eligible loyalty scheme to

        <p>
            When you use the TenX Services to send funds to someone else, we will ask
            you to provide information related to that transaction. This information
            includes the amount and type of transaction (such as purchase of goods,
            purchase of services, or simple peer-to-peer transfer), and the details
            pertaining to the identity of the third party. Also, when you send money to
            another TenX customer, you may be asked to provide your personal details to
            that customer to complete the transaction. Your personal details may then
            be passed on to us from that customer. We also collect the IP address and
            other identifying information about the computer or device you use to
            access your TenX account or use the TenX Services, in order to help detect
            possible instances of unauthorized transactions.

            at or leave the TenX website, we automatically receive the web address of
            the site that you came from or are going to. We also collect information on

            unsuccessful payment. To facilitate dispute resolutions, we may provide a

        <p>
            We work with third parties to enable them to accept or facilitate payments

            share information about you with us such as your email address or phone
            number, when a payment is sent to you or when you are attempting to pay
            that third party. We use this information to confirm that you are a TenX
            customer and that TenX can be enabled to make a payment, or where a payment
            is sent to you to send you a notification that you have received a payment.
            Also, if you request that we validate your status as a TenX customer with a
            third party, we will do so. Please note that third parties you receive
            funds or buy from may have their own privacy policies, and TenX is not
            responsible for their operations, including but not limited to their
            information handling practices.

        <h3>6. Cross Border Transfers of your Information</h3>
        <p>
            6.1 Please note that some of the recipients of your information referred to
            above will be based in countries outside of Singapore. TenX is committed to
            adequately protecting your information regardless of where the data resides
            and to providing appropriate protection for your information where such
            data is transferred outside of Singapore.
        </p>
        <p>
            6.2 TenX will use best efforts to ensure that the third party service
            providers engaged by the TenX Group in connection with the TenX Services
            will not transfer information about you to a place outside Singapore
            without the prior written consent of the TenX Group. In the event that the
            TenX Group provides such consent, TenX will use best efforts to procure
            that the relevant third party service provider provides a written
            undertaking to the TenX Group that the information about you which is
            transferred outside Singapore will be protected at a standard that is at
            least comparable to that under the Personal Data Protection (No. 26 of
            2012) of Singapore. If the relevant third party service provider transfers
            information about you to any person overseas, TenX will use best efforts to
            procure that such third party service provider procures the same written
            undertaking from such person.
        </p>
        <h3>7. Retention of your Account Information</h3>
        <p>
            7.1 We will retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the
            purposes outlined in Section 3. However, we will retain your information
            for a longer period where required by law and for the duration of any
            statutory limitation period for claims.
        </p>
        <p>
            7.2 In general, although there are limited exceptions, we will retain your
            information during the period when you are using the TenX Services and for
            at least seven (7) years after your use of the TenX Services ceases.
        </p>
        <h3>8. Information Security</h3>
        <p>
            8.1 TenX is committed to handling your information with high standards of
            information security. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data
            encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files,
            and we authorise access to information only for those employees who require
            it to fulfil their job responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            8.2 The security of your TenX account also relies on your protection of
            your TenX password. You may not share your TenX password with anyone. TenX
            representatives will never ask you for your password, so any email or other
            communication requesting your password should be treated as unauthorized
        and suspicious and forwarded to    <a href="mailto:support@tenx.com">support@tenx.com</a>. If you do share
            your TenX password with a third party for any reason, including because the
