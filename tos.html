                  <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Legal Jurisdiction</b></h3>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">You expressly agree that any claim or dispute arising from your use of our website and/or our services will be governed by the laws of Singapore without regard to the conflict of law provisions thereof. You further agree that any such claims or disputes shall be resolved in Singapore courts, and you agree to be subject to the personal jurisdiction in, and the exclusive venue of, such courts and waive any objection to such jurisdiction and venue for the purpose of litigating any such claim or dispute.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>PART 1: GENERAL USE</b></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">By signing up to use the TenX Account through the TenX website located at tenx.texh, the TenX API, and/or any associated TenX-hosted websites or mobile applications (collectively the “TenX Site”), you agree to comply with and be legally bound by this Agreement. <b>If you do not agree to any of the terms set forth in this Agreement, or any subsequent modification to the Agreement, you may not access or use any of the TenX Services and must cancel your TenX Account, free of charge, in the manner set forth below.</b></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">We may amend or modify this Agreement by posting on the TenX Site or emailing to you the revised Agreement. Any revised Agreement shall be effective immediately upon your express approval, or one month after the date of posting except where the changes and modifications are required by law or on the instruction of a competent governmental agency. By continuing to access or use the TenX Services once the revised Agreement is effective, you agree to be bound by the Agreement. We may (a) modify or discontinue any portion of the TenX Services, and (b) suspend or terminate your access to the TenX Services, at any time, and from time to time, without notice to you in certain, limited circumstances described herein. You agree that we shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification or termination of the TenX Services, or suspension or termination of your access to the TenX Services, except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth herein.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">To be eligible to use the TenX Services, you must be at least 18 years old (or the applicable age of majority and contractual capacity). By accessing or using the TenX Services you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older. You may also be eligible to use the TenX Services if you are at least 13 years old, but only if your parents provide express written consent. Parental consent for use of the TenX Services by an individual who is at least 13 years old must be forwarded to support@tenx.texh.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Please note the following risks of using TenX Services:</b></p>
                  <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                    <li>Once submitted to the Bitcoin network, a Bitcoin Transaction (defined below) will be unconfirmed for a period of time (usually less than one hour, but up to one day or more) pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the Bitcoin network. A transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. Bitcoin associated with transactions that are in a pending state will be designated accordingly, and will not be included in your TenX Account balance or be available to conduct transactions.</li>
                    <li>The risk of loss in holding bitcoin can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether holding bitcoin is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. In considering whether to hold bitcoin, you should be aware that the price or value of bitcoin can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero. If you use a TenX product which allows you and/or third parties to access and hold bitcoin private keys, you acknowledge that TenX is not responsible for safeguarding such keys and that TenX is not responsible for any loss of bitcoin resulting from theft, loss, or mishandling of bitcoin private keys outside its control.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. Basic TenX Services.</b></h3>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Your TenX account (“TenX Account”) encompasses the following basic TenX Services, among others:</p>
                  <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                    <li>One or more hosted bitcoin wallets that allows users to store bitcoin private keys, and to track, transfer, and manage their bitcoin and account information and through which TenX can facilitate Bitcoin Transactions pursuant to instructions submitted by a user or authorized entity to TenX (the “Bitcoin Wallet”);</li>
                    <li>A bitcoin payment service through which users can buy goods and services, and sell bitcoin to, TenX (the “Payment Service”); and</li>
                    <li>For verified users in certain countries, accounts you may fund with Singapore Dollars, Chinese Yuan, Euros, British Pounds, U.S. Dollars, or Canadian Dollars for use in connection with the Payment Service, and/or other services as TenX may permit from time to time (each, a “Currency Wallet”).</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Each of these TenX Services is described in detail below.</p>
                  <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. Creating a TenX Account.</b></h3>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.1. Registration of TenX Account.</b> In order to use any of the TenX Services, you must first register by providing your name, e-mail address, password, and affirming your acceptance of this Agreement. Upon successful completion of the registration process, TenX will establish your TenX Account. TenX may, in our sole discretion, refuse to allow you to establish a TenX Account, or limit the number of TenX Accounts that a single user may establish and maintain at any time.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.2. Identity Verification.</b> In order to use certain features of the TenX Services, including certain transfers of bitcoin and/or currency, you may be required to provide TenX with certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, government identification number, and information regarding your bank account (e.g., financial institution, account type, routing number, and account number). TenX may also require you to answer certain questions or take actions in order to verify your identity, provide the TenX Services to you, or comply with applicable law. In submitting this or any other personal information as may be required, you verify that the information is accurate and authentic, and you agree to update TenX if any information changes. <b>You hereby authorize TenX to, directly or through third parties make any inquiries we consider necessary to verify your identity and/or protect against fraud, including to query identity information contained in public reports (e.g., your name, address, past addresses, or date of birth), to query account information associated with your linked bank account or qualifying credit/debit cards (e.g., name or account balance), and to take action we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries and reports. You further authorize any and all third parties to which such inquiries or requests may be directed to fully respond to such inquiries or requests.</b></p>
                  <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>3. Bitcoin Wallet.</b></h3>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.1. Sending and Receiving Bitcoin.</b></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.1.1.</b> As part of the services offered in connection with your TenX Account, TenX can help you send bitcoin to, and request and receive bitcoin from, third parties pursuant to instructions you provide through the TenX Site (each such transaction is a “Bitcoin Transaction”). You may initiate a Bitcoin Transaction by going to the TenX Site, choosing to send or request, and entering the requisite information regarding the sender or recipient and the amount of bitcoin to be transferred. TenX will then communicate with the Bitcoin network on your behalf, as necessary, to facilitate each Bitcoin Transaction in accordance with these instructions.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.1.2. TenX reserves the right to refuse to process or to cancel any pending Bitcoin Transaction as required by law or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order. TenX cannot reverse a Bitcoin Transaction which has been communicated to and confirmed by the Bitcoin network.</b></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.1.3.</b> TenX processes Bitcoin Transactions according to the instructions received from its users and we do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other party. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to TenX as the relevant Bitcoin Transaction may not be cancelled or reversed once initiated.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.1.4.</b> If you initiate a Bitcoin Transaction by entering the recipient’s bitcoin address, TenX will confirm that the bitcoin address is valid; however, TenX cannot confirm that the bitcoin address belongs to the intended recipient. In the event you initiate a Bitcoin Transaction by entering the recipient’s email address and the recipient does not have an existing TenX Account, TenX will email the recipient and invite them to open a TenX Account. If the designated recipient does not open a TenX Account within 30 days, TenX will return the bitcoin associated with the transaction to your TenX Account.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.2 Bitcoin Storage &amp; Transmission Delays.</b> TenX securely stores 100% of all bitcoin private keys in our control in a combination of online and offline storage. As a result, it may be necessary for TenX to retrieve this information from offline storage in order to facilitate a Bitcoin Transaction in accordance with your instructions, which may delay the initiation or crediting of such Bitcoin Transaction for 48 hours or more. As a user of the TenX Services, you accept the risk that a Bitcoin Transaction facilitated by TenX may be delayed and you agree not to hold TenX responsible for any damages or injury arising out of or related to such delay.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.3. Your Bitcoin Transactions.</b></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.3.1 Third Party Transactions.</b> TenX has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party (including other users of TenX Services). TenX is not responsible for ensuring that a buyer or a seller you are dealing with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. If you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, a third party in connection with bitcoin transferred using the TenX Services, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you must handle it directly with that third party. Due to the nature of bitcoin, any Bitcoin Transaction conducted using the TenX Services is final regardless of any defects in or non-delivery of any goods or services purchased in connection with such Bitcoin Transaction, or any other aspect of your transaction or relationship with the relevant third party. If you believe a third party has behaved in a fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate manner, or if you cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third party, you may notify TenX Support at support@tenx.texh so that we may consider whether to take any action.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.3.2. Refunds.</b> TenX is not responsible for merchant refund policies. Certain merchants may wish to process a refund to you via a separate Bitcoin Transaction having a value equal to the transaction amount being refunded, as expressed in local currency (e.g., Euros), based on the then current Conversion Rate. As a result, you may receive less (or more) bitcoin via a refund than you initially used to pay the Merchant.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.3.3. Taxes.</b> It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions associated with your receipt or transfer of bitcoin, and/or to the Bitcoin Transactions you conduct through the TenX Services, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Your transaction history is available through your TenX Account.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.4 Limits.</b> TenX reserves the right to change the transfer, payment, storage and velocity limits applicable to your Bitcoin Wallet in our sole discretion. We may require you to provide us with information about yourself and/or your Bitcoin Transactions if your transactions exceed certain government reporting thresholds, such as thresholds regarding financial recordkeeping and tax reporting.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.5 Advanced Protocols.</b> We do not currently support metacoins, colored coins, or any advanced protocol which supplements the core Bitcoin Protocol. TenX does not detect whether Bitcoin Transactions associated with your TenX Account may involve any such protocol use. Do not use your TenX Account to effect any instruction or transfer involving an advanced protocol. TenX is not responsible for any loss which may result from such use.</p>
                  <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>4. Payment Service.</b></h3>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4.1. Transactions with TenX.</b> When buying goods and services through the Payment Service you are selling bitcoin to TenX directly. In this capacity, TenX does not act as an intermediary or marketplace between other buyers and sellers of bitcoin. The Payment Service is subject to the TenX “Conversion Rate.” “Conversion Rate” means the liquidity adjusted price of a given bitcoin amount in terms of local currency as quoted to you on the TenX Site at the time you begin a Payment transaction. For the purpose of any transaction which incorporates the Conversion Rate, you agree, as a condition of using any TenX Services, to accept the Conversion Rate as the sole conversion metric.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4.2. Limits.</b> TenX imposes limits on the number of bitcoin that you may hold in a given moment, and that you may hold in your Currency Wallet, as further described in the <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement?country=GB#appendix-2:-verification-procedures-and-limits">Verification Procedures</a>. TenX reserves the right to change posted limits as we deem necessary or appropriate from time to time. TenX does not guarantee the availability of its Payment Service, and the act of purchasing goods and services with TenX does not result in a guarantee that you may sell your bitcoin to TenX. If you wish to raise your limits, you may submit a request to support@tenx.texh. We may require you to submit additional information about yourself or your business, provide records, and arrange for meetings with TenX staff (such process, “Enhanced Due Diligence”). TenX reserves the right to charge you costs and fees associated with Enhanced Due Diligence, provided that we notify you in advance of any such charges accruing. In our sole discretion, we may refuse to raise your limits or we may lower your limits at a subsequent time even if you have completed Enhanced Due Diligence.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4.3. Payments.</b></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4.3.1.</b> You agree to have bitcoin in TenX wallet to prior to using Payment Service. If your bitcoin in TenX wallet does not have sufficient funds to cover the purchase goods and services, TenX may immediately reverse/cancel the transaction. TenX is under no obligation to attempt to fulfill your purchase using an alternative payment method should your bitcoin payment method fail. You hereby authorize us to debit your Currency Wallet(s) or any of your payment methods which have been linked to your TenX Account for the full or partial amount of your purchase and any other amounts owed by you to us hereunder. We may resubmit debits or charges to your payment methods until all amounts owed by you to us hereunder are satisfied in full.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4.3.2.</b> We may deduct bitcoin held by you in a Bitcoin Wallet equal to purchase amount of goods and services if a payment is successful. If such a payment is subject to a chargeback, reversal, claim or is otherwise invalidated. We may settel a transaction back to your wallet in bitcoin at current conversion rate as of the moment of settlement.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4.3.3. Refunds.</b> In the event of refund TenX will refund via a separate Bitcoin Transaction having a value equal to the transaction amount being refunded, as expressed in local currency (e.g., Euros), based on the then current Conversion Rate. As a result, you may receive less (or more) bitcoin via a refund than you initially used to pay the Merchant.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4.3.4.</b> <b>We reserve the right to refuse to process, or to cancel or reverse, any purchases even after bitcoin have been deducted from your account(s), including but not limited to instances where TenX suspects the transaction involves (or has a high risk of involvement in) money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime, in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order, or if TenX suspects the transaction relates to Prohibited Use or a Prohibited Business as set forth below. In such instances, TenX will reverse the transaction and we are under no obligation to allow you to reinitiate a purchase at the same price or on the same terms as the cancelled transaction.</b></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4.3.5.</b> <b>You do not have a statutory right to withdraw from a transaction to settle payment with bitcoin once you have instructed TenX because the price of bitcoin fluctuates in accordance with the financial market for bitcoin which is outside the control of TenX.</b></p>
                  <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>5. Currency Wallet.</b></h3>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>5.1. Currency Wallets.</b> Users who have verified their identity with TenX and who reside in approved jurisdictions may establish and fund a Currency Wallet. Except as otherwise set forth herein, you may use your Currency Wallet only (1) to purchase bitcoin from TenX, (2) to receive the proceeds of bitcoin sales to TenX, (3) to transfer funds to and from your originating bank account, or (4) to transfer funds to and from a TenX Account. Once you have successfully completed the requisite Verification Procedures, you may transfer currency from your bank account to TenX using approved bank transfer methods in accordance with the limits set forth herein. Although TenX will not charge a fee to facilitate such transfers, you may be required to pay bank transfer fees.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>5.2. Availability.</b> TenX currently offers its Payment Services only in “Approved Countries,” listed on the website, <!--and TenX offers a Euro-denominated Currency Wallet (“Euro Wallet”) to Eurozone users who reside in Approved Countries. For certain verified users in the U.K., you may also have up to two additional Currency Wallets: a British Pound denominated Currency Wallet (“GBP Wallet”), and a U.S. Dollar denominated Currency Wallet (“USD Wallet”). For certain verified users in Canada, you may have either a USD Wallet or a Canadian Dollar denominated Currency Wallet (“CAD Wallet”), but not both, and additional terms for a Currency Wallet in Canada can be found below. -->You understand that only users who reside in Approved Countries and who are verified with the required level of verification applicable in the user’s country may transfer funds to TenX and fund a Currency Wallet. If you send funds to TenX and your Account has not been successfully verified for the required level of verification applicable in your country, or your residence or bank account is not within an Approved Country, or if you send funds in excess of the permitted daily limits, then TenX will return all or the excess portion of funds to the originating bank account without adding funds to your Currency Wallet. Bank fees may apply to such transfers, and you are responsible for any such fees. All funds held in a Currency Wallet are held on trust by TenX for the benefit of the user and may be used solely (1) to purchase bitcoin from TenX, (2) to transfer funds to your Trading Account, when permitted, (3) to refund you by transferring funds to your originating bank account, (4) to provide you with the proceeds of the sale of bitcoin to TenX by transferring funds to your bank account.</p>
                  <!--<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>5.3. Deposits and Withdrawals.</b> You may visit your Account at TenX.com/accounts and click on a Currency Wallet to transfer funds between your linked bank account(s) and TenX as necessary to deposit funds into or withdraw funds from your Currency Wallet(s). TenX will not charge a fee for you to transfer funds to or from TenX, but bank transfer fees may apply. Funds sent via bank wire (if permitted by TenX) are subject to additional wire fees. For deposits, TenX will credit your Currency Wallet(s) a corresponding amount of Euro, GBP, USD, or CAD, as applicable, after funds are delivered to TenX, typically within two to three business days after you authorize a deposit. For withdrawals, TenX will immediately debit your Currency Wallet when you authorize a withdrawal and funds will typically settle to you within two to three business days. Bank fees are netted out of transfers to or from TenX. We will not process a transfer if associated bank fees exceed the value of the transfer.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>5.4.

                  <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTION AND ACTIVITY REPORTS</b></h3>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Company will diligently monitor transactions for suspicious activity. Transactions that are unusual will be carefully reviewed to determine if it appears that they make no apparent sense or appear to be for an unlawful purpose.  Internal controls will be implemented so that an ongoing monitoring system is in place to detect such activity as it occurs. When such suspicious activity is detected, the Company will determine whether a filing with any law enforcement authority is necessary.</span></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suspicious activity can include more than just suspected money laundering attempts.  Activity may be suspicious, and the Company may wish to make a filing with a law enforcement authority, even if no money is lost as a result of the transaction.</span></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Company will initially make the decision of whether a transaction is potentially suspicious. Once the Company has finished the review of the transaction details, he or she will consult with the Company’s senior management to make the decision as to whether the transaction meets the definition of suspicious transaction or activity and whether any filings with law enforcement authorities should be filed.</span></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Company will maintain a copy of the filing as well as all backup documentation. The fact that a filing has been made is confidential. No one, other than those involved in the investigation and reporting should be told of its existence. In no event should the parties involved in the suspicious activity be told of the filing. The Company may inform the Company’s Board of the filing and the underlying transaction.</span></p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">      </span></p>
                  <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</b></h3>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasonable procedures for maintaining records of the information used to verify a person’s name; address and other identifying information are required under this Policy.

                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Company is required to maintain a record of identifying information provided by the customer.</span></li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where the Company relies upon a document to verify identity, the Company must maintain a copy of the document that the Company relied on that clearly evidences the type of document and any identifying information it may contain.</span></li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Company must also record the methods and result of any additional measures undertaken to verify the identity of the customer.</span></li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Company must record the resolution of any discrepancy in the identifying information obtained.</span></li>

                  </ul>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">             </span></p>
                  <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>AML AUDIT</b></h3>
